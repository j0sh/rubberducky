Rubberducky, yet another RTMP media server.

Requires libev, librtmp, and openssl.

This acts as a stream reflector. Publish a stream in the format
    rtmp://localhost/appname/streamname
and connect some clients to it.


The makefile will probably have to be modified locally to suit your needs.

$ make
$ ./a.out

Most codecs should be able to pass through without trouble, including
H.264 and AAC, but Linear PCM/uncompressed audio might have problems.
